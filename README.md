I'm a Machine Learning engineer (weird to say out loud but here I am).
I'm passionate about Computer Vision.

In my free time, I try to learn new things here and there.

I write. My writing is available on [alessandroai.com](https://www.alessandroai.com) and on [Medium](https://alessandroai.medium.com/). I write about what I learn and what I live.

Here's a list of my most viewed posts:

* [Become a Machine Learning Engineer in 2022](https://medium.com/artificialis/become-a-machine-learning-engineer-in-2022-c377f2b5891b)

If I'm interested in something, you'll find me talking or writing about it.

Currently working on world-wide projects at [IPS Intelligence](https://www.ips-intelligence.com/).

In June 2021, I founded Artificialis, a community of Artificial Intelligence enthusiasts, practitioners, writers.
